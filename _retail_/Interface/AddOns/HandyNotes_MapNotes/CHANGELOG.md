# MapNote
## [2.2.8](https://github.com/Ssesmar/MapNote) (2024-09-07)
- Note:

-- MapNotes now works on every version of World of Warcraft. Classic Era / Cataclysm / Retail / PTR

Retail:

    add a new area in the generally tab für chat messages
    A confirmation query has been added for Hide MapNotes, Hide Worldmapbutton, Hide Minimapbutton and synchronize capitals & capitals minimap as well as for synchronize zones & minimap icons
    An error has been fixed that was caused when you activated or deactivated Unexplored Area and Fog of the Unexplored if the world map had not been opened once before
    Activating or deactivating icons of an entire tab (Capitals, Zones, Continents, Azeroth, Worldmap or Dungeons (activate icons)) now opens the corresponding area of ​​the world map
    For example, if the world map is open and a Horde player is in a Horde capital other than Orgrimmar, that map will of course not be changed
    The switch will only take effect if the map is closed, you have opened the map of an enemy capital or are on another map type (Zone/Azeroth/Worldmap/Dungeon) when you activate or deactivate this map tab
    Every activation or deactivation button in an entire tab now has this function
    The switch only takes effect if the map is closed, or you are in an enemy capital, or you are on a different map type when you activate or deactivate this map tab

Different maps open for Horde , Alliance and Neutral
    Horde:
        Capital = Orgrimmar
        Capital Enemy = Stormwind
        Zone = Durotar
        Zone Enemy = Elwynn Forest
        Continent = Kalimdor
        Dungeon = Icecrown Glacier

    Alliance:
        Capital = Stormwind
        Capital Enemy = Orgrimmar
        Zone = Elwynn Forest
        Zone Enemy = Durotar
        Continent = Eastern kingdom
        Dungeon = IcecrownGlacier

    All icons can be activated or deactivated separately and all icons can also be hidden or shown with a single click. Called  "Hide MapNotes!"
    You can use the MapNotes symbols with or without shift-clicking. Called "Shift function"
    Display special MapNotes icons for Horde and Alliance that display additional information on all maps. Called "MapNotes VS. blizzard"
    Display icons of the other faction that can be activated by the other faction. Called "Enemey Faction"
    All symbols are clickable (except on the minimap) and have a function
    Normally, on a maximized map, you cannot use instance icons from Blizzard or other addons that would open the adventure guide.
    But not for MapNotes u can use all functions on minimized or maximized maps!

Map function with or without Shift. Simply select the “Shift Function” in the MapNotes menu on or off:

    Shift+Right-click or Right-click adds a TomTom waypoint (except on the Azeroth map)

    Shift+Left-click or Left-click on a Portal, Exit, Passage, Ship, Zeppelin, Transport or Old Instance icon displays the associated map
    For example: When you hover over a portal icon, the name of where that portal would go will appear. For example => Orgrimmar. If you click on this symbol, the map of Orgrimmar will open (Regardless of whether the map is reduced in size or in full screen, both work)
