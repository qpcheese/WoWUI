## Changed in v62

* Bring in systems improvements from [my War Within plugin](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-war-within), notably:
    * Redesign of the settings and menus
    * Filters for rares and treasure so you can choose to show only "notable" ones, which you can configure
    * Color the rare icons to show whether they've got any of those notable things on them -- purple for unknown transmog, blue for more exclusive things
    * Setting for whether to track transmog by shared appearance, or from the specific item (the previous behavior)
    * Support for MapPinEnhanced when setting waypoints
