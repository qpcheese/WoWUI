# Soulbind Cache Opener Continued

This addon is a spiritual spin-of from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/soulbind-cache-opener .

Please fell free to submit pull requests to: https://github.com/choss/soulbind-cache-opener-continued

This addon provides an easy way to open various rewards found in The War Within and other wow expansions. You will no longer need to search through your bags for Dragon Isle Knowledge, Drake Customizations, Cache Rewards and more. Up to 20 buttons will be provided for your opening needs. You can hide various items in the options interface.

This addon will create a movable button that only appears when you have something to open. If you have multiple items to open, there will be a new button for each type.

The button is movable by dragging with the Right Mouse Button. Type /soulbindcacheopener reset OR /sco reset to reset the button position Type /sco or /soulbindcacheopener for the help. It also shows you how to ignore certain items. 
There is also a settings page available for ignoring item groups.

Currently Supported Openables:

- A bunch of TWW openables gathered by checking wowhead
- All openables up to 10.2.7 (Dragonflight)

If there are more openables that I have missed, let me know. If you need more item groups to ignore, just tell me and I will see what I can do.
